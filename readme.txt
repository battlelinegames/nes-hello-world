| This code was taken from rainwarrior's example    |
| code.  Basically it runs all the ca65 commands    |
| that build and link your project.  I've also      |
| included all the ca65 exe files in the cc65       |
| directory in this project.  It's not necessary to |
| put that in every project you build, but I feel   |
| that it makes things a bit easier when you're     |
| starting out.                                     |

| This is the ca65 config file which is used by ca65 to figure out how the output rom binary    |
| file is going to be arranged.  If you open up an early NES cartridge like Super Mario Bros    |
| (the original) you'll find it contains 2 ROM chips.  One chip labeled PRG and the other       |
| labeled CHR.                                                                                  |
|                                                                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

CHR contains the sprite (character) data that gets loaded into the                            
PPU (Picture Processing Unit) and is used to draw game graphics.                             
                                                                                            
PRG contains the program ROM data as well as other constant data that is non graphical.      

The first portion of the file contains the MEMORY section.  The lines HDR, PRG, and CHR have 
  file = %0 in them.  This tells the assembler that those sections will actually be placed     
  inside the game's rom file when assembled.  The three lines ZP, OAM, and RAM have file = ""  
which indicates to the assembler that these parts of memory will be generated at run time and
will not have an area of memory in the ROM file itself.

The SEGMENTS portion of the file will allow you to tell the assembler from the code where in  
memory, or in the rom file you would like your code, or your variables to go.  For instance,
you may have something like this:

The segments we used above have to correspond to segments defined in the .cfg file that point
to parts of memory.  In the SEGMENTS section of our config file we create ZEROPAGE to point
to the ZEROPAGE portion of memory.  This part of memory executes a few cycles faster than the
rest of memory.  The OAM portion is used to transfer sprite data to the PPU.  VARS can be used
to create variables in memory.  It is slower than the ZEROPAGE segment, but there is much more
of it.  The HEADER segment is used to create the iNES header that is used by an emulator.  It doesn't
correspond to anything that was on a cartridge.  The CODE segment corresponds to a PRG ROM chip on
the cartridge.  You can use this for a place to put assembly code.  ROMDATA is pointing at the 
later portion of the PRG ROM.  If you like you can remove this line and use CODE for all of your
constant data, but this gives us a nice way to separate it.  You may want to adjust the start = 
part of that line if you find yourself using more ROMDATA than assembly code.  You can use ROMDATA
for constant information like level definitions or enemy definitions.  The IMG corresponds to the 
CHR ROM and is where you should put your .chr file.

This file contains a series of .include directives to include all of the other files we are using in 
this project.  It also contains the main game loop.  For this particular project the game loop won't
be doing anything.  In a typical game, you would want to include all the code that does not directly 
interact with the PPU in this game loop.  Because all we are doing is drawing "HELLO WORLD" to the  
game screen.  You would usually want to process the movement of all of your game objects inside the 
game loop, then move your data to the PPU inside the NMI.

This file sets up the first 13 bytes of the .nes file that this project will output.  These bytes
don't correspond to anything that would be on the cartridge.  They are used by an emulator to 
configure the software to know what kind of hardware you're emulating.  

The first 4 bytes are always the same "NES" followed by a hex $1A.  An emulator would first look
at these 4 bytes so it would know that yes, this really is an iNES file.

The fifth byte tells the emulator how many 16K memory banks the program is using.  We have 2 program
banks we are using.  If you want to use more than that, you need what is called a Mapper.  I won't 
be covering those here, so I suggest leaving that number alone.

The sixth byte tells the emulator how many 8K memory banks you are using for image data.  Unfortunately
if you're not using a mapper, this number has to stay at 1.  

The seventh byte contains a bunch of flags and values that are used for more advanced NES game programming.
For this project we are going to leave all of those flags set to 0.

After that we are using six more bytes of padding that were meant for expansion of the iNES format, but
probably will never be used for anything.

At the very end of the header.asm file we set the last 6 bytes of your file.  These bytes are used by 
all 6502 programs to know where to execute three interrupts

The ppu.asm file defines all the PPU registers we will be interacting with as we write our game.  
We've also defined some procedures that interact with the PPU including the following

load_attribute - loads the attribute table in the PPU
load_palettes - load the sprite and background palettes into the PPU
oam_dma - used to move all the sprite data to the PPU

we also define the oam memory block of 256 bytes in this file

I've used this to define several variables that will hold the gamepad buttons that are currently pressed,
newly pressed, and newly released.  I also have a bunch of defines for the button flags like PRESS_A 
and PRESS_START which you can check with an AND or a BIT test against gamepad_press or gamepad_new_press.
The values in these variables are set when you call the set_gamepad procedure that should be executed in
the game loop.

In this file I create the macro printf_nmi.  This printf doesn't really take variables.  You have
to pass in assembly time constants.  This is basically where the "HELLO WORLD" happens.

A lot of general use utility macros like wait_for_vblank which just loops until the next vblank hits.
set for instance just sets the first variable to the value in the second.  It basically just does an
lda and an sta because I find myself doing that all the time.

This is the file that contains the label where we set the irq vector.  We aren't using this right now,
but if you get into mappers you may have one that does use this interrupt.  You can kick off the irq
in the code if you want with the BRK command, but we will not be doing that in this game.

NMI stands for Non-Maskable Interrupt.  The NMI is executed whenever the screen is in the middle
of a refresh and not drawing anything.  You can only interact with the PPU when it is not busy
drawing the game screen, so you have about 2200 cycles to work with inside the NMI to interact
with the PPU.  Around 500 of those cycles are used to move sprite data to the PPU in what is called
a DMA, which leaves you about 1700 cycles to modify the background.

The reset vector gets called when the system powers up, and when the player hits the "Reset" button
on the game console.  Since the console has random data in it's memory when it powers up, you should
clear all data when you start up.
